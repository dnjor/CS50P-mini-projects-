# Weather App

## Description
A simple small project that tells you the weather for any city you want to know about.

## Purpose
I built this project to practice:
- requests  
- JSON  
- exceptions  
- libraries  
- API usage  

## Features
1. Tells you which country the city is in  
2. Shows the sunrise and sunset times  
3. Shows the temperature  
4. Tells you if it’s sunny, rainy, or cloudy  

## How to Use
Type the name of the city, and the program will give you the weather information.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- requests  

## Data Source
This project uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to get the data.
