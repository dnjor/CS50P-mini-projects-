# QuickBill

## **Project Name:** QuickBill

**Project Description:**
QuickBill is a simple program that helps restaurants display the menu in an organized table format, showing food items and their prices. It allows customers to select their food and place an order. Once the order is complete, the program generates a text file containing the details of the ordered items, their prices, and the total bill.

**Project Idea:**
This program was developed in response to a problem with the software being used in my family’s restaurant. The main idea is to display the menu in an organized manner, take orders, and create a text file invoice containing food details and prices. This is a starting solution for restaurants.

**Learning and Development:**
In this project, I am learning how to work with **tests** and **files** in a practical way. I applied concepts I learned in the course to test the validity of user inputs and save the information in text files. This program is the beginning of developing my skills in handling tests and files in programming.

**Requirements:**
- `tabulate` library to display the menu in a table format
- `csv` library to create and save the invoice in a text file

**How to use:**
1. Run the program.
2. Choose "menu" to display the menu or "order" to start placing your order.
3. Once the order is finished, a text file invoice will be generated.
